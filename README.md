# JSONlogin
Minimal HTML login page that uses a json file as a database


Minimal login system that requires a new user to input username, password and then give the generated string (which contains the username and the encrypted password) to the webadmin. The webadmin then has to add the entry in the "database" file, which is called ".user_db", in the same folder as the rest of the files.
OBVIOUSLY, fairly useless unless you have HTTPS, fairly useless if the user passes the password to the webadmin through an insecure connection...

WIP, more clear instructions & coming... sometime in the future :)
